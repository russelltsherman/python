# if elif else

```py
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")
else:
    print("a is greater than b")

```

## Short Hand If

If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.

```py
if a > b: print("a is greater than b")
```

## Short Hand If ... Else

If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line:

```py
a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")
```
