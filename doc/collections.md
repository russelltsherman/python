# Python Collections (Arrays)

There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

- `Dictionary` is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed.
  No duplicate members.

- `List` is a collection which is ordered and changeable.
  Allows duplicate members.

- `Set` is a collection which is unordered and unindexed.
  No duplicate members.

- `Tuple` is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
  Allows duplicate members.

When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.
