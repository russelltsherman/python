# Python Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

- [Arithmetic operators](./operators/arithmetic.md)
- [Assignment operators](./operators/assignment.md)
- [Comparison operators](./operators/comparison.md)
- [Logical operators](./operators/logical.md)
- [Identity operators](./operators/identity.md)
- [Membership operators](./operators/membershipo.md)
- [Bitwise operators](./operators/bitwise.md)
