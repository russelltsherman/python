# Python Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description    |
| -------- | -------------- |
| +        | Addition       |
| -        | Subtraction    |
| \_       | Multiplication |
| /        | Division       |
| %        | Modulus        |
| \*\*     | Exponent       |
| //       | Floor Division |

```py
a=10
b=20
```

## Addition

Adds values on either side of the operator.

```py
a + b = 30
```

## Subtraction

Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.

```py
a â€“ b = -10
```

## Multiplication

Multiplies values on either side of the operator

```py
a * b = 200
```

## Division

Divides left hand operand by right hand operand

```py
b / a = 2
```

## Modulus

Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder

```py
b % a = 0
```

## Exponent

Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators

```py
a**b =10 to the power 20
```

## Floor Division

The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are removed.
But if one of the operands is negative, the result is floored, i.e., rounded away from zero (towards negative infinity)

```py
9//2 = 4
9.0//2.0 = 4.0
-11//3 = -4
-11.0//3 = -4.0
```
