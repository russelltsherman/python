Python Membership Operators
Python’s membership operators test for membership in a sequence, such as strings, lists, or tuples. 
There are two membership operators as explained below −


in	Evaluates to true if it finds a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise.	
x in y, 
here in results in a 1 if x is a member of sequence y.

not in	Evaluates to true if it does not finds a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise.	
x not in y, 
here not in results in a 1 if x is not a member of sequence y.
