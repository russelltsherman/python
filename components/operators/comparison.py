Python Comparison Operators
These operators compare the values on either sides of them and decide the relation among them. 
They are also called Relational operators.

==	If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.	
(a == b) is not true.

!=	If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	
(a != b) is true.

<>	If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	
(a <> b) is true. This is similar to != operator.

>	If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	
(a > b) is not true.

<	If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	
(a < b) is true.

>=	If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	
(a >= b) is not true.

<=	If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
