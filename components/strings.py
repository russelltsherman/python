Python Strings
Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks. 
Python allows for either pairs of single or double quotes. 
Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the string and working their way from -1 at the end.

The plus (+) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator.

str = 'Hello World!'

print(str)          # Prints complete string
print(str[0])       # Prints first character of the string
print(str[2:5])     # Prints characters starting from 3rd to 5th
print(str[2:])      # Prints string starting from 3rd character
print(str * 2)      # Prints string two times
print(str + "TEST")  # Prints concatenated string
